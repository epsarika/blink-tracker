### Project Description
Blink Tracker is a fun and competitive real-time blink detection app that tracks multiple players‚Äô blinks live through your webcam. It challenges you to keep your eyes open the longest while monitoring rapid blink bursts, displaying live stats and playful messages ‚Äî perfect for a ‚ÄúNo Blink Tournament‚Äù showdown!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where staring contests are the ultimate test of willpower, there‚Äôs no reliable way to track who blinks first ‚Äî until now! Everyone‚Äôs been struggling to keep a straight face without blinking, but no app has dared to declare a true blink champion. Blink Tracker solves this non-problem by turning your webcam into the ultimate blink referee!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Blink Tracker is here to obsessively monitor your blinking habits in real-time ‚Äî because someone has to keep score! It turns your webcam into a blink-detecting champion, throwing out fun messages when you blink too fast or don‚Äôt blink at all. Who knew eye movements could be so competitive and entertaining?
